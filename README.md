**We are interested in the association between the posted standby wait time for a popular amusement park ride and how many units of merchandise were sold that day.** [Link](http://phackathon.netlify.com/) 
 
* We are interested in the relationship between between the standby posted wait time (SPOSTMIN) for the amusement park ride and how many units of merchandise were sold that day (MERCHANDISE).
 
* Using the data provided, find the smallest (i.e. most significant) p-value. We will host a leaderboard here throughout the challenge.
 
* There are missing values. Some of them are coded as <NA>, others are coded differently, for example for the column indicating standby posted wait time (SPOSTMIN) if the ride was closed, it is coded as -999. Be sure to examine the data dictionary for the variables you are using.
 
* There are two levels of data, time-level, and day-level. The time-level data, indicated by columns with unique values based on DATETIME, has unique values by second within days. For example, SPOSTMIN has many unique values within each day, for each wait time reported. The day-level variables are constant by DATE. For example, the column MERCHANDISE is constant by date.

(This challenge will run until midnight EDT on July 27th.)
